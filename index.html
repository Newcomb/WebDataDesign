<h1>Newcomb Maddux</h1>
  <p> I am driven to expand my knowledge, make new friends, and grow as a person. I hope that Computer Science will help me in this process
    because it challenges me to step out of my comfort zone and think outside of the box. Along with taking Computer Science classes, I 
    also play on the tennis team at Centre College. I have played tennis since childhood and it's given me a lot of great experiences and 
    friends over the years. Overall, I strive to not only grow academically but socially as well while having fun on the tennis courts.</p>
